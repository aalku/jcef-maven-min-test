# JCEF minimal demo with Spring Boot

This is an html file served by Spring Boot and open by Chromium Web browser embedded in a JWT JFrame window

It uses jcefmaven to get the JCEF resources.

Spring dev-tools auto-reload is not working so it's disabled in main()

(This might not be a good example, I don't really know what I'm doing)
